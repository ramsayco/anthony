    <div id="p01">ABOUT ME</div>  
    <br>
    <br>
    <div id="p02"> Good Day world, My Name is Frank Ramsay, currently I  am a self-employed Construction Consulting Engineer<br>
                                                                                                                   <br>
        
     and at this point in life, I am transitioning in different, excited and challenging Careers .<br>
                                                                                                                       <br> 
                                                                                                                       
    I have several interesting hobbies ,of which travelling is at the top of the list . I travelled frequently to other countries    <br>
                                                                                                                                      <br>
    such as the Bahamas, Jamaica ,Barbados, Canada, Mexico,Aruba, England , Dubai and Africa . Countries which I am intending to <br>
                                                                                                                                  <br>     
    visit in the next two years are Sweden, Paris ,Australlia, Copenhaugen, Norway, Japan , South Korea and the Phillipines. <br>
                                                                                                                                    <br>    
     Finally after all this , I will relocate and hopefully reside in Panama. During all this travelling I will some how find time to  <br>
                                                                                                                                           <br>
    to learn to play the Violine and the Paino. I am rushing to do this in a minute as LIFE IS JUST FOR LIVING and above all it's very short.<br>
